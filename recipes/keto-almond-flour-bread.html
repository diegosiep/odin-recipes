    <h1>Keto Almond Flour Bread</h1>
    <p>For all you ketogenic people out there, this recipe is one
        of my all-time favourite types of bread. Enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredient list:</h2>
        <ul>3 1/2 cups of blanched Almond Flour</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cup of grass-fed butter <em>(or extra virgin oil)</em></ul>
        <ul>210 g of 0 % fat greek yoghurt</ul>
        <ul>3 eggs</ul>
        <ul>1/4 tsp of salt</ul>
        <ul>1/4 cream of tartar</ul>
    <h2>Procedure:</h2>
        <ol>1. Mix the dry ingredients <em>(i.e.almond flour, salt and cream of tartar) </em>
            in a plastic recipient.
        </ol>
        <ol>2. Mix the wet ingredients <em>(i.e. eggs, greek yoghurt, grass-fed butter)
        </em> in another plastic recipient.</ol>
        <ol>3. Mix the wet and dry ingredients.</ol>
        <ol>4. On a medium-sized steel recipient for bread, spray a little bit of oil and
            the blended mixture you previously did.</ol>
        <ol>5. Place the recipient inside of the oven at 180 C for 45-50 minutes.</ol>
        <ol>6. Enjoy!</ol>
        <p><em> EXTRA TIP: Place a knife on top of the bread and take it out.
            If it comes clean, it means your bread is ready, but if it does not, 
            wait for 10 more minutes.
