    </h3>
        <p>I bet you didn't know this, but I am a dietitian.
            I studied nutrition here in Mexico and back in the days
            when I was studying, I gathered a lot of different healthy recipes
            which helped me stay fit and healthy throughout this process.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, this also helped me understand the needs of other
            people and apply these ideas to my own patients' nutrition plans.
        </p>
        <p>Nowadays, I am more interested in learning how to code and also,
            earn a living from it.

        </p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy some of the recipes that 
            I am going to leave right here.
        </p>
        <p>Should you have any doubt whatsoever, I am here to help you out!</p>
